# What Everything is

I am going to try to update this with information about each little project I do, and also resources I used for those projects.

## Rust

Did a few basics tutorials, then made a rust web scraper. I enjoy not having to deal with C's memory.

The book:

helpful looking cheatsheet:
https://cheats.rs/
- actually this has a lot of cool info, ie about abstraction machinery
